## Project Description
In this Project Exam i was tasked with creating an platform were an user can book their holday on an bunch of different venus. An user can also register as an Venue manager that allows for creating venues that users can place bookings on.

##  tech stack

   - Github Projects
     
 Framework:
   - React

## Project setup
 - clone this repo: https://github.com/Noroff-Anders/Project-Exam-2.git

 - In terminal run the following commands:

    To install all dependecies``` npm install ```
   
    To run the project run ``` npm run start ```

## Known issues:

 - I am aware of a bug with the navbar. It does not update after login. This issue came up during the final hours and was not able to debug in time. After logging in, refresh the page to get the correct links. An User might need to refresh page to get to profile and see their upcoming bookings

 -  For storing of the API keys, Localstorage was used. I am aware that this is not best practice and the API key should never be exposed in the frontend.

 - title is not updated on none of the pages and there is som design flaws.
